# Unofficial DU EPhD Cohort Resources

This repository collects general resources, quick guides, and reference materials related to work at the University of Denver.  
The goal is to have a central place where I (and collaborators) can quickly find and reuse common instructions, code snippets, and setup guides.

## What’s Inside
The repository will include a variety of resource files such as:
- **Terminal and Git Quick Guide** – Everyday shell navigation, file management, and Git workflows.  
- **HPC Quick Guide** – How to connect to DU’s High-Performance Computing cluster, run jobs with SLURM, and launch JupyterLab.  
- Additional tips, cheat sheets, and best practices as they are gathered over time.
